# Getting Started

So, you want to give Menuify a test-run to see how it works. Well then, this guide will help you.

First off, you need to install Menuify.
> Note: This only works on windows

Next you want to double-click the `menuify.cmd` file.
This file requires adminstrative privileges to run.

Once complete you can start using menuify. 
Use the arrow keys to navigate the menuify menu.
Using menufiy requires an accellerated terminal that supports basic coloring, utf-8, and double-buffers.
